The Renault FT, introduced in 1917 during World War I, is widely considered one of the most revolutionary tank designs in history. Unlike earlier tanks, which were large, cumbersome, and difficult to maneuver, the FT introduced the modern tank layout: a rotating turret mounted on top of a fully tracked chassis, a driver compartment at the front, and the engine in the rear. This configuration became the standard for nearly all subsequent tank designs, making the FT a pivotal innovation in armored warfare.

Armor on the Renault FT was relatively light, ranging from 8 mm to 22 mm. While it was sufficient to protect the crew from small arms fire and shrapnel, it was not impervious to artillery or heavy machine guns. Despite its thin armor, the tank’s mobility and low profile allowed it to operate effectively in trench-laden battlefields, where speed and maneuverability were often more valuable than heavy protection.

The main armament came in two primary variants: either a 37 mm Puteaux SA 18 gun or a 7.92 mm Hotchkiss machine gun. The gun version allowed the FT to engage enemy fortifications and light vehicles, while the machine-gun variant was used primarily for infantry support. The rotating turret allowed 360-degree targeting, giving the tank tactical flexibility that previous designs lacked, and enabling it to support infantry advances without requiring the tank itself to reposition constantly.

Mobility was one of the FT’s defining advantages. Weighing only around 6–7 tons and powered by a 35 hp gasoline engine, it could reach speeds up to 7 km/h over rough terrain — modest by modern standards but significant for the trench-filled battlefields of World War I. Its fully tracked chassis allowed it to traverse shell-cratered ground, climb obstacles, and cross trenches, providing a level of battlefield mobility that earlier tanks could not achieve.

Operationally, the Renault FT proved highly effective in late World War I, particularly during Allied offensives in 1918. Its small size and maneuverability allowed it to infiltrate enemy lines, provide direct fire support to infantry, and exploit breakthroughs in the static trench warfare environment. Its success was such that France and other countries produced thousands of units, and it saw continued use in various conflicts well into the interwar period.

In summary, the Renault FT’s revolutionary design — rotating turret, front driver, rear engine, and fully tracked chassis — set the blueprint for modern tanks. While lightly armored and modestly armed, its mobility, versatility, and tactical innovation made it far more effective than previous designs. The FT’s influence can be seen in almost every tank that followed, cementing its legacy as a foundational vehicle in the history of armored warfare.
