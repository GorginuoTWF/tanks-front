In the first echelon of the 47th Panzer Corps’ attack advanced the 20th Panzer Division and the 6th Infantry Division, reinforced by two companies of Tigers (28 machines on establishment). Two panzer divisions of the second echelon were to exploit the breakthrough and continue the advance. Progress of the first echelon was slowed by the resistance of the Red Army’s 15th Rifle Division on heavily fortified positions and by extensive minefields. By 08:00 passages had been cleared through the minefields. Interrogation of a captured Red Army soldier revealed a weakly defended sector at the junction between the 15th and 81st Rifle Divisions, and the German heavy tanks were redirected there. At this point the Tigers were counter-attacked by approximately 90 T-34 tanks. In the ensuing three-hour tank battle, 42 T-34s and two Tigers were destroyed, while another five Tigers were immobilized by track damage. Having repelled this Soviet tank counter-attack, the Germans broke through the first defensive belt. However, during those three hours the units of the 29th Rifle Corps of the 13th Army, which were positioned behind the first belt, moved forward and closed the gap in the front line. Soviet artillery fire greatly hampered the work of German engineers clearing passages, even when they used remote-controlled demolition vehicles (Goliath and Borgward IV). By 17:00, of the 45 Ferdinand tank destroyers of the 653rd Heavy Tank Destroyer Battalion, 33 had lost mobility due to mine damage. Most of these Ferdinands were later repaired, but evacuating such heavy vehicles from the battlefield proved extremely difficult.

During the first day of the offensive, the 47th Panzer Corps managed to advance almost 10 km into the Soviet defenses, while the 41st Panzer Corps reached the heavily fortified settlement of Ponyri, through which ran the second Soviet defensive belt as well as the highway and railway leading to Kursk. Wehrmacht losses for the day amounted to 1,287 killed and missing and 5,921 wounded.

On the following day, 6 July, the 17th and 18th Guards Rifle Corps, together with the 2nd Tank Army and the 19th Tank Corps, were scheduled — in accordance with previously received orders — to launch a counter-attack against the German 9th Army. However, due to poor coordination, at dawn on 6 July only the 16th Tank Corps of the 2nd Tank Army (approximately 200 tanks) went over to the attack after an artillery preparation. The blow fell on the positions of the 47th Panzer Corps and was met by Tigers of the 505th Heavy Tank Battalion. Having lost 69 tanks in the fighting, the 16th Tank Corps withdrew to the positions of the 17th Guards Rifle Corps of the 13th Army around the village of Olkhovatka, through which the second defensive belt passed.

Thereafter the 47th Panzer Corps itself, after conducting its own artillery preparation, attacked toward Olkhovatka, leading with the 24 Tigers that remained operational. This attack was repulsed with heavy German losses. At 18:30 the Soviet 19th Tank Corps arrived at the positions of the 17th Guards Rifle Corps, further strengthening the defense. Additionally, on Rokossovsky’s orders, the majority of serviceable tanks were placed in specially prepared hull-down dug-in positions, which reduced their vulnerability. Simultaneously with Olkhovatka, attacks were launched against Ponyri, defended by the 307th Rifle Division of the 29th Rifle Corps. This assault was carried out by one panzer and three infantry divisions of the Wehrmacht (9th Panzer, 292nd, 86th Infantry, and 78th Assault Divisions), but they failed to dislodge the defenders from their strongly fortified positions.

Before the start of ground operations on 5 July, at 06:00 Moscow time, the Germans also delivered air and artillery strikes against the Soviet defensive lines. The core of the German armored force consisted of the Ferdinand self-propelled gun and the new medium Panther tank. By the evening of the first day of the battle, 55 % of the enemy self-propelled guns that detonated mines on the Central Front had been put out of action. The advancing German tanks immediately encountered serious resistance from the tank units of Lieutenant-General A.G. Rodin’s 2nd Tank Army. The main blow on the northern face was delivered on 6 July in the direction of Olkhovatka. Having failed to achieve success, on 9 July the Germans shifted the effort toward the Ponyri railway station, but here too they were unable to break through the Soviet defenses. T-34 tanks put up stubborn resistance to the German tanks that had penetrated into the depth of the defense, managing to push the enemy back 1.3 km despite their own losses. Model’s grouping on the northern face succeeded in wedging only 10–12 km into the Soviet defenses, after which, from 10 July and having lost up to two-thirds of its tanks, the German 9th Army went over to the defensive.

Model’s plan for breaching the three defensive belts of the Central Front called for an initial blow by infantry divisions reinforced with heavy tanks and assault guns, supported by artillery and aviation. After breaking through the enemy defenses, the panzer divisions were to develop the success toward Kursk. In accordance with this plan, in the center — on the main axis — operated the 47th Panzer Corps reinforced by the 505th Heavy Tank Battalion (Tigers). To its left was the 41st Panzer Corps with the attached regiment of Ferdinand SPGs (83 vehicles). The left flank of the entire grouping was covered by the 23rd Army Corps consisting of three infantry divisions (including the reinforced 78th Assault Division) with 62 assault guns. On the right flank operated the 46th Panzer Corps, which despite its name consisted of four infantry divisions and possessed only 9 tanks and 31 assault guns.

As early as March 1943, when organizing and planning the defense of the Kursk salient, the Stavka of the Supreme High Command foresaw the transition to the offensive by the troops of the left wing of the Western Front, the Bryansk Front, and the Central Front (after eliminating the results of the German offensive). On 12 July the Western Front (commanded by Colonel-General Vasily Sokolovsky) and the Bryansk Front (commanded by Colonel-General Markian Popov) launched a strategic offensive (according to the previously developed plan code-named “Kutuzov”) against the German 2nd Panzer Army and 9th Army in the Orel area. The plan also provided for participation of Central Front troops (right flank) attacking from the Ponyri–Arkhangelskoe area. By the end of 13 July Soviet forces had broken through the enemy defenses. On 26 July the Germans were forced to abandon the Orel salient and began withdrawing to the “Hagen” defensive line (east of Bryansk). At 05:45 on 5 August Soviet troops completely liberated Orel.

By the beginning of August 1943 the overall situation on the Soviet-German front, including the western strategic direction, was determined by the victories won by the Soviet Army at Kursk. It was important for Soviet command to inflict defeat on as many enemy forces as possible through active operations on other sectors, so that the Germans could not transfer them to oppose the Red Army’s counter-offensive. The western direction, being directly adjacent to the Kursk salient area, was one of the priority sectors. The Stavka prepared a major offensive operation code-named “Suvorov”, which began on 7 August with attacks by the Western Front and the left wing of the Kalinin Front.

Chief of Red Army Artillery Marshal N.N. Voronov noted: “Over the command of the Kalinin and Western Fronts, and over me as the Stavka representative, there constantly hung the Damocles sword of the threat of ‘having our heads cut off’ if even one division were transferred by the enemy from here to the south, where the main tasks were being decided.” Commander of the Kalinin Front General A.I. Eremenko added:

The successful development of combat operations on the northern and southern faces of the Kursk strategic salient created favorable conditions for delivering a blow from its apex into the junction between German Army Groups South and Center. The possibility of exploiting this opportunity had been envisaged as early as the planning of the 1943 summer campaign: “A blow toward Kharkov, Poltava, and Kiev was, in the opinion of the General Staff, the most promising.” S.M. Shtemenko notes that the idea of destroying the enemy’s southern grouping did not affect the main western strategic direction; Army Group Center would threaten the flanks of the advancing fronts.
