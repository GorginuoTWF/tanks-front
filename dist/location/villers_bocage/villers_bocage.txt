While preparing the “right hook,” the British relied on intelligence that suggested the vanguard of the 7th Armoured Division would not encounter serious resistance. This was not the case. Blocking the road to Villers-Bocage was the elite 101st SS Heavy Tank Battalion, which had been ordered to march toward Normandy as early as 7 June. Allied air raids and terrible roads caused many of the battalion’s tanks to break down. Nevertheless, by the end of 12 June, ten Tigers of the 1st Company and six machines of the 2nd Company had reached their deployment areas on the left flank of the 1st SS Panzer Corps. The first detachment, led by SS Hauptsturmführer Rolf Möbius, took up positions in Nouail-les-Bois, 10 km northeast of Villers-Bocage. The second group was commanded by the famous ace Michael Wittmann. His tanks halted for the night on the slopes of Côte de Lande, marked on British maps as “Hill 213.” The Tiger commanders were SS Untersturmführers Georg Hantusch, Herbert Stief, and Kurt Sowa; SS Oberscharführers Jürgen Brandt and Georg Lotsch; and SS Obersturmführer Jürgen Wessel. Wittmann immediately sent Wessel’s tank to Juvigny to find elements of the Training Panzer Division. Wittmann himself arrived in Villers-Bocage “horseless” — his Tiger No.205 broke down, so he switched to a Schwimmwagen.

Sergeant O’Connor of A Company was likely the first British soldier to notice the Tiger approaching the highway. He was riding in one of the half-tracks heading toward Hill 213. Due to the landscape, Wittmann’s tank had already covered half the distance between the old Caen road and Highway 175. Without hesitation, O’Connor broke radio silence. But his immediate superior, Lieutenant Alfie de Pass, dismissed the report as an error. The blast of an 88 mm shell corrected the misunderstanding instantly.

At the beginning of the attack, Wittmann saw only two British tanks — a Cromwell and a Sherman Firefly of the 1st Troop, A Squadron. The first shot destroyed the Cromwell, the second the Firefly. It happened so quickly that neither crew understood what had struck them. The third tank of the troop, positioned on the opposite side of the road, was not spotted by Wittmann until his Tiger reached the highway. By that time, smoke from the burning Firefly already obstructed visibility toward Hill 213. After the third tank was destroyed, the stretch of road leading to the crest of the hill was almost completely obscured from Wittmann’s view. But now he could clearly see the column of A Company’s armored vehicles. It seems Wittmann originally intended to attack only the vanguard of the armored regiment to cut it off from the main forces, but the decision to head toward Villers-Bocage appears to have been spontaneous once he detected a weakness in the British formation.

Left: View from a bend of the main street toward Jeanne d’Arc Square. In the foreground is the Sherman of Major Wells, commander of the artillery observation troop of the 5th Royal Horse Artillery. The first shell fired by Wittmann’s gunner exploded beside the tank. The second struck the right side of the turret and ignited it. Because of this tendency to catch fire from the first hit, Shermans were grimly nicknamed “Ronson lighters.” In the background is the silhouette of the Tiger Wittmann abandoned on Rue Pasteur near the town hall square.  
Center: Another tank of the 5th Royal Horse Artillery observation troop — Captain Victory’s Cromwell, serial number T187749, knocked out by Wittmann on Rue Curie. According to Victory, an 88 mm shell only disabled the turret traverse mechanism. The tank was likely set on fire later by Germans fearing the town might fall completely into British hands. This illustrates the uncertainty that persisted in Villers-Bocage throughout 13 June.  
Right: Captain Dice’s Cromwell, halted at the entrance to the Geroux farm. Serial number T187577. Dice claimed that a Tiger shell hit the turret, but photos do not confirm this.

Meanwhile, after seating one of his crew in the gunner’s position, Captain Dice set off in pursuit of the Tiger. Some accounts claim Dice attacked Wittmann’s tank as it was returning from the town to Hill 213. However, Wittmann’s Tiger was knocked out in the center of Villers-Bocage (confirmed by photos). Therefore, their duel could only have happened in the brief interval between the destruction of Major Wells’ Sherman OP and the Tiger’s move along Rue Clemenceau to a position no longer visible from the Geroux farm entrance, where Dice’s tank was destroyed. As Dice recounted many times in interviews, he saw the Tiger when the distance between them was no more than 100 meters. The Cromwell’s gun fired two or even three shots, but none caused damage. The shells may have missed — smoke from the burning OP Sherman made aiming difficult, and firing at such short distances required special skill. Meanwhile, the Tiger rotated its turret toward the British tank and destroyed it with the first shot.

Wittmann’s tank continued along Rue Clemenceau. Reaching the intersection with Rue Curie, he spotted another British tank. Captain Victory’s attempt to turn his Cromwell resulted in a cobblestone lodging under the drive wheel, immobilizing the tank. When the Tiger appeared, the crew fled into a nearby building. Moments later, their tank suffered the fate of the others in the headquarters troop.

By that time Lieutenant Pearce’s armored car had already crossed the town and reached the leading tank of B Squadron. He informed Sergeant Lockwood, commander of a Sherman Firefly, that a Tiger was approaching from the upper town and had destroyed much of the forward group. Pearce ordered Lockwood to move up and take a position from which he could fire down the main street.

Having dealt with Victory’s tank, Wittmann seems to have hesitated. The main street was empty. Danger could lurk behind any corner, and surprise was no longer on his side. Even so, he decided to press on. Fearing ambushes, the gunner swung the turret toward each side street as the tank approached intersections. Yet Lockwood still managed to catch the German ace off guard.

His Firefly crossed Jeanne d’Arc Square and passed the last house on the smoke-filled Rue Pasteur when the silhouette of the Tiger appeared ahead. At that moment the Tiger was nearing the Town Hall Square, its turret turned left. No more than 200 meters separated the tanks. Lockwood gave the order, and the Firefly’s gun fired the shell that began the duel which ended Wittmann’s raid.
